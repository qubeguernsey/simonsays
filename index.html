<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p class="lead">Simon Says is a health food bar dedicated to freshening up your lunch hour.</p>

<p>Each day we will be busy creating a fresh selection of tasty salads, sandwiches, breakfasts
  and cakes from the Simon Says kitchen. Our salad bar will also house the building blocks of
  vibrant salads and mezze platters so that you can create your own.</p>

<p>Menus will vary daily depending on what is in season and fresh in our kitchen. We aim to
  cater for everyone, so whether your intolerance is gluten or dairy, meat or wheat there
  should be something you can wrap your taste buds around.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t forget our smoothie bar serving refreshing, made-to-order, juices. Based on our freshly
  delivered natural ingredients you can try one of our favourite blends or adapt them to suit
  your own taste.</p>
